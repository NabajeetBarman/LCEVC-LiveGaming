# Evaluation of MPEG-5 Part 2 (LCEVC) for Gaming Video Streaming Applications Dataset

With the increasing advancements in video compression efficiency achieved by newer codecs and intelligent encoding strategies, as well as improved bandwidth requirements, there has been a proliferation and acceptance of newer services such as Netflix, Twitch, etc. However, many applications are delay tolerant and the latest video compression standards have become more complex. Hence, there is a requirement for faster, more efficient codecs to achieve higher encoding efficiency without significant trade-off in terms of both complexity and speed. We present in this work an evaluation of the latest MPEG-5 Part 2 Low Complexity Enhancement Video Coding (LCEVC) for live gaming video streaming applications. The results are presented both in terms of bitrate saving using both subjective and objective quality measures as well as a comparison of the encoding speeds. Our results indicate that LCEVC outperforms both x264 and x265 codecs in terms of both bitrate savings using VMAF and MOS scores as well as in terms of encoding speed. The results as well as some sample LCEVC decoded video sequences are made available as part of an open source dataset.
