# Evaluation of MPEG-5 Part 2 (LCEVC) for Gaming Video Streaming Applications Dataset

With the increasing advancements in video compression efficiency achieved by newer codecs and intelligent encoding strategies, as well as improved bandwidth requirements, there has been a proliferation and acceptance of newer services such as Netflix, Twitch, etc. However, many applications are delay sensitive and the latest video compression standards have become more complex. Hence, there is a requirement for faster, more efficient codecs to achieve higher encoding efficiency without significant trade-off in terms of both complexity and speed. We present in this work an evaluation of the latest MPEG-5 Part 2 Low Complexity Enhancement Video Coding (LCEVC) for live gaming video streaming applications. The results are presented in terms of bitrate savings using both subjective and objective quality measures as well as a comparison of the encoding speeds. Our results indicate that LCEVC outperforms both x264 and x265 codecs in terms of both bitrate savings using VMAF. Using subjective results, it is found that LCEVC outperforms the respective base codecs, especially for low bitrates. This effect is much more dominant for x264 as compared to x265. However, for x265 the absolute improvement of quality scores is marginal. The objective and subjective results as well as sample video sequences are made available as part of an open dataset, LCEVC-LiveGaming.
